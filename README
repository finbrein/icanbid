Welcome to iCANBID Java / J2EE Online Auction and Shopping Website 

*********************************************************************************************************************
Introduction

This is a simple auction site that allows a user to browse and buy goods. 

In this application, visitors can browse goods by Category. 

Technologies used include Java, J2EE, JSP, HTML, CSS, MySQL. The development environment is Eclipse IDE for Java EE 
developers.

The AuctionApp folder contains the project demo including all the resources. 

Note that the current installation of iCANBID is on my local machine. Therefore changes have to be done to make it run on 
another machine. 

My current effort is to improve the program further.
